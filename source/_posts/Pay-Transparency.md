This post contains all of my salaries since I began my career. Salaries with an asterisk next to them are estimates - the true figure has been lost to time. Bonuses are not included for the same reason; I don't remember the percentages of the bonuses I recieved.

I have no degree. I have one certification, the SANS GWAPT, which I acquired in 2017 after working at Riot. I am a white male and, at time of my first job, was 18.

Rent cost in the United Kingdom includes council tax.

|Salary|Year|Title|Employer|Location|Rent (pcm)|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|£16k|2013|Junior GIS Application Developer|Pragmatic Systems|Newport, Wales|£400|
|£18k|2013|Systems Analyst and Developer|RUMM|Ystrad Mynach, Wales|approx £560|
|£21k|2015|Internal Applications Developer|Creditsafe|Cardiff, Wales|£800|
|£24k|2016|Internal Applications Developer|Creditsafe|Cardiff, Wales|£800|
|€50k|2016|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1500|
|€55k*|2017|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|
|€62k*|2019|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|

|€90k|2021|Senior Security Engineer (current)|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€2000|
|$164k|2022|Senior Security Engineer|Riot Games|Los Angeles, California|est $3500|

Here's the same information but formatted with monthly post-tax disposable income (ie income minus rent and tax-deductible expenses, like healthcare). In Dublin, I have been paying 5% salary to pension and around 120 per month in dental, vision and healthcare. All of these are not included in 'disposable income', as they are pre-tax.

It is difficult to find tax calculators for previous years for Ireland, so all figures here are rated in tax as if it was 2021. This generally means the figures will be slightly higher than they would have been at the time.

|Disposable Income (pcm)|Year|Title|Employer|Location|Rent (pcm)|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|£742|2013|Junior GIS Application Developer|Pragmatic Systems|Newport, Wales|£400|
|£695|2013|Systems Analyst and Developer|RUMM|Ystrad Mynach, Wales|approx £560|
|£625|2015|Internal Applications Developer|Creditsafe|Cardiff, Wales|£800|
|£795|2016|Internal Applications Developer|Creditsafe|Cardiff, Wales|£800|
|€1439|2016|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1500|
|€1541*|2017|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|
|€1824*|2019|Associate Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|
|€2148*|2020|Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|
|€2598|2020|Senior Security Engineer|Riot Games|Dublin, Ireland|€1600|

|$5723|2022|Senior Security Engineer|Riot Games|Los Angeles, California|est $3500|

Note that the LA entry does not include healthcare since I do not know how much that will cost yet.

Bonuses, Equity etc
---

Riot has a bonus system that rewards you with an annual bonus, as well as a longer term bonus. This effectively means you have two bonuses, your annual bonus and your long term incentive bonus. Each bonus is the product of a percentage of your own salary and a multiplier, based off of company and personal performance for each year. However, this is a new system, and I don't remember all the numbers. Because it's based off of a percentage of your base salary, having a higher salary means you get more in bonus by default.

For my current title - Senior Security Engineer, as of 2021 - The base amount of my bonus, both annual and long-term, is 15%.

Because the amount is based on a percentage of your base salary **and** a modifier (which has always been above 1.5 for me, but does not necessarily have to be), it's difficult to estimate what total compensation is. If we assume that the modifier **is** 1.5 (it can be higher, and can be lower), then my total comp is:

|Source|Amount|
|----|----|
|Base Salary|€90,000|
|Annual Bonus|€20,250|
|LTI Bonus†|€20,250|
|**Total**|€130,500|
|**Total (post-tax)**|€72,234|

† The LTI bonus is received 3 years from the calendar year it is issued. For example, if I receive a multiplier of 1.5 for 2021, I will receive the bonus for that year in 2024.
